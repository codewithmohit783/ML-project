## Overview
Predicting Medical Insurance Costs using Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using data analytics and machine learning techniques. The model seeks to provide more accurate estimations by analyzing key factors that influence healthcare expenditures, such as age, lifestyle choices, medical history, and socioeconomic status. With rising healthcare costs globally, this predictive model aims to help insurance providers price policies fairly and assist individuals in making informed financial decisions.

By leveraging historical data and identifying patterns, the model not only improves cost accuracy but also enables insurers to better manage risk and design personalized policies. Ultimately, the goal is to foster transparency, fairness, and trust within the healthcare system.
